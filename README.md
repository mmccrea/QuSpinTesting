# QuSpinTesting
Code, manuals and results from testing the quspin sensor for use in the TUCAN nEDM experiment.

The goal is to have simultaneous readout of the Quspin sensor and the data from an oscilloscope measuring the output voltage of a function generator that is powering a small coil inside a magnetic shielding apparatus.
